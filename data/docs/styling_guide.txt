When recommending outfits, start with the user's occasion and climate. Favor breathable fabrics for travel and commutes. For office wear, neutral bases like charcoal, black, and ivory create mix-and-match versatility. Add one texture (denim or knit) to keep looks approachable. Avoid bulky layers if the client wants a sleek silhouette.
